egui-stylist is an embeddable application that can be embedded anywhere that egui can be embedded.

egui-stylist allows for you to create and save egui-themes that can be embedded into any existing egui applications or environments.

Currently this is used as an addon created for [godot-egui](github.com/setzer22/godot-egui/), but can be easily embedded into any existing egui applications.
